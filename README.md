# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this page to keep a record of the major ideas about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git that I learned during my bootcamp prework. 
This webpage puts the basics of these 4 technologies all in one place to help me prepare for the bootcamp, and any beginner could benefit from reading the content.
While coding this webpage, I learned about HTML structuring a website, CSS styling the HTML elements, JavaScript adding randomness, and Git's ability to save various versions of a project.

Scan through each card to learn basic commands and give them a try in your own development environment. You can also navigate to the console in Chrome DevTools to receive a random suggestion for which technology to study next, if you have extra time and need a push in a certain direction.
